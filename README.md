# Auto-Collapse Explorer

Auto-Collapse Explorer attempts to keep the Explorer neat and tidy by only
expanding the directory of the file that is currently in focus. All directories
are closed.

## Features

When focus changes to a new document, that document is revealed in the file tree
and all other open folders are collapsed.

Thanks for trying out this extension! Hope you enjoy!

## Contributing

Pull requests are always welcome. VS Code is not my everyday editor and
maintenance/enhancement of this extension suffers.
