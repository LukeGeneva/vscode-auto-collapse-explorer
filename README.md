# Auto-Collapse Explorer

Messy file trees got you down? Tired of scrolling endlessly to no avail? Are you suffering from chronic health problems?
Have an uppity boss? Irritating coworker? Delinquent child? No child? Too many childs? Well, we can't help you with most
of that, but we can help you with messy file trees...maybe. Actually, I don't know if we can or not, but why not give
this extension a try anyway, eh? It'll save you the time of having to hit that "Collapse Folders in Explorer" button we
all know and love.

## Features

Auto-collapses directories not in use. When focus changes to a new document, that document is revealed in the file tree
and all other open folders are collapsed.

Thanks for trying out this extension! Hope you enjoy!
